# CellBouncer
Tools for pooled single cell sequencing experiments. 

CellBouncer can:
* Demultiplex cells 
  * by species
  * by mitochondrial haplotype
  * by individual of origin
  * by cell hashing identity
  * using sgRNA capture data
* Quantify ambient RNA
  * Infers proportion per cell
  * Infers the fraction of ambient RNA originating from each individual
* Infer a global doublet rate
  * Use results from one or more demultiplexing types
